/**
 * @title ActivityTracker
 * @notice Tracks oracle member activity and oracle active status
 * @dev Separated from Genesis due to contract size limits (EIP-170: 24KB)
 *
 * This contract stores:
 * - memberLastActivity: When each oracle member last participated (voted/proposed)
 * - oracleActiveStatus: Whether each oracle has enough active members
 *
 * Activity tracking enables the system to:
 * 1. Ensure oracles have engaged members (90-day activity threshold)
 * 2. Prevent disputes from going to stale/inactive oracles
 * 3. Incentivize ongoing participation from oracle members
 *
 * Authorized callers:
 * - NativeAthena: Updates member activity on voting, sets oracle status
 * - NativeDAO: Updates member activity on governance actions
 * - OracleManager: Initializes member activity when adding to oracles
