# OpenWork Multi-Chain System Architecture

**Last Updated**: September 27, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0 - Base Sepolia Main Chain Integration

---

## 🏗️ **System Overview**

The OpenWork protocol is a sophisticated multi-chain decentralized freelancing platform that operates across multiple blockchain networks using LayerZero for cross-chain messaging and Circle's CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) for USDC transfers.

- ✅ **Cross-Chain Messaging** - Routes job events to appropriate chains

---

### **🔗 Local Chain(s) (OP Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia)**
**Role**: Job Execution & User Interface  
**EIDs**: 40232 (OP), 40161 (ETH)  
**CCTP Domains**: 2 (OP), 0 (ETH)  

**Contracts:**
- **LOWJC** - Local OpenWork Job Contract (job posting and applications)
- **Athena Client** - Local dispute interface
- **CCTP Transceiver** - Local USDC payment handling
- **Local Bridge** - LayerZero messaging to Native Chain

**Responsibilities:**
- ✅ **Job Posting** - Users post jobs on preferred chains
- ✅ **Job Applications** - Workers apply from any local chain
- ✅ **Local Payments** - Users can pay/receive on preferred chains
- ✅ **Dispute Initiation** - Raise disputes that route to Native Chain

### **Message Types:**

#### **1. Job Lifecycle Messages**
- **Local → Native**: Job posting, applications, work submissions
- **Native → Local**: Job approvals, payment releases, dispute outcomes

#### **2. Governance Messages**
- **Native → Main**: Voting power sync (earned tokens), governance actions
- **Main → Native**: Governance decisions, parameter updates, upgrades

#### **3. Payment Messages**
- **Local ↔ Native**: CCTP USDC transfers for job payments
- **Native → Main**: Rewards token distribution requests

#### **4. Dispute Messages**
- **Local → Native**: Dispute initiation, evidence submission
- **Native → Local**: Dispute outcomes, fund releases

#### **5. Profile & Rating Messages**
- **Local → Native**: Profile creation, portfolio additions, user ratings
- **ProfileManager**: Manages all user profile data, stores in Genesis contract
- **Native → Local**: Profile confirmations

## 💰 **Payment & Token Flow**

### **USDC Payments (via CCTP)**
```
Job Giver (Local Chain) → LOWJC → CCTP → NOWJC (Native) → CCTP → Job Taker (Any Chain)
```

### **OpenWork Token Rewards**
```
Job Completion (Native) → Native Rewards → Native DAO → Main Bridge → Main Rewards → Token Distribution
```

### **Governance Voting Power**
```
Staked Tokens (Main) + Earned Tokens (Native) = Combined Voting Power
```

---

## 🎯 **Data Flow Examples**

### **Example 1: Job Posting Flow**
1. **User posts job** on OP Sepolia LOWJC
2. **LOWJC** sends message via Local Bridge → Native Bridge → NOWJC
3. **NOWJC** validates and stores job data in Genesis
4. **NOWJC** sends confirmation back to LOWJC
5. **Job is live** across all connected chains

### **Example 2: Dispute Resolution Flow**
1. **Dispute raised** on Ethereum Sepolia Athena Client
2. **Message routed** via Local Bridge → Native Bridge → Native Athena
3. **Native Athena** handles voting and resolution
4. **Outcome sent** back to all relevant chains
5. **Funds released** automatically via CCTP

### **Example 3: Governance Flow**
1. **User earns tokens** completing jobs on Native Chain
2. **Native DAO** tracks earned tokens for voting power
3. **Voting power synced** to Main DAO on Base Sepolia
4. **Combined voting power** (stake + earned) used for governance
5. **Governance decisions** executed across all chains

---

## 🔐 **Security & Trust Model**

### **LayerZero Security**
- **Peer Configuration**: Each bridge only accepts messages from authorized peers
- **Message Verification**: All cross-chain messages are cryptographically verified
- **Upgrade Protection**: Only Main DAO can upgrade contracts across chains

### **Economic Security**
- **Dispute Stakes**: Users stake tokens to participate in dispute resolution
- **Governance Stakes**: Minimum stake required for proposal creation
- **Earned Token Voting**: Voting power tied to actual platform usage

### **Contract Ownership**
- **Main Chain**: Owned by Main DAO (decentralized governance)
- **Native Chain**: Owned by Native DAO with Main DAO oversight
- **Local Chains**: Owned by respective bridges with cross-chain governance
